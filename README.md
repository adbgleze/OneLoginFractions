# OneLoginFractions
Fractions program as coding challenge from OneLogin

###### Instructions to run:
- Clone this repo
- Use the saved configurations on the IDE to run specific command into the program

In case of wanting to run a different command you can add another configuration or edit the an existing one and 
replacing the param arguments with the arguments you want to provide. This is the equivalent to run the jar file with 
the params at the terminal **java -jar jar-file-name [args â€¦]** where args are the parameters, in this case the
command to execute.

######Existing configurations:
- 1/2 * 3_3/4
- s (My mistake to leaving it there but works to test an invalid command)
- 2_3/8 + 9/8
- Help (To show the program's help)
- FractionOperationsTest (Used to test the fraction operations)
